Pill
====

A convenience wrapper around grep which allows you to easily pillage your code base.

This tool is still under heavy development and will be moved to [The Backplane GitHub](https://github.com/Backplane) once it is stable.

Installation
============

1.) In the top-level Pill directory (the one you found this README in),
you simply need to type 'make' in the command prompt. This will compile
Pill as well as its dependency (jsoncpp) and place the pill executable
in the 'bin' folder.

Note: If you would like access to the intermediate object files for
debugging with gdb, type 'make debug', and they will be waiting for
you in the 'bin' folder.

2.) After compiling the Pill executable, you will want to export it to
your path for easy command-line use. You can do this by typing the
following in the command prompt:

    export PATH="$PATH/path/to/Pill/bin/"

Flags
=====

For a list of flags that can be used as options for Pill on the command
line, type:

    pill --help

Customization
=============

You may customize Pill via the options.json and roles.json files in
the 'options' folder. The format of these objects is listed below. Note
that, although you need not have all the fileds filled (or any at all)
in either of these JSON files, the objects themselves must be defined
as at least an empty object literal ({}).

1.) options.json:

    {
        "role":         DEFAULT_ROLE_STRING, (defaults to "")
        "max_results":  DEFAULT_NUM_RESULTS_RETURNED, (defaults to 25)
        "root":         DEFAULT_PATH_STRING_FOR_SEARCH, (defaults to "./")
        "editor":       DEFAULT_EDITOR_FOR_OPENING_FILES_FROM_SEARCH (defaults to "vim")
    }

An example may be:

    {
        "role":           "frontend",
        "max_results":    100,
        "root":           "/Users/me/Desktop/Code",
        "editor":         "nano" // lol I know, good joke
    }

2.) roles.json:

This file associates an string value to an array of strings which each
denote a file extension. The array should be in order of greatest to least
importance of file type results returned from Pill.

    {
        "SOME_STRING_KEY_DEFINING_A_ROLE": ARRAY_OF_FILE_EXTENSIONS,
        "SOME_OTHER_ROLE":                 ANOTHER_ARRAY_OF_FILE_EXTENSION_STRINGS
    }

An example might be:

    {
        "frontend": ["js", "html", "css"],
        "backend":  ["php", "py", "java"]
    }

Note that, if command line flags are passed in, those will take precedence
over default options in options.json. If an option in options.json is not
present and a command line flag has not been defined for that option, the
default for that specific option detailed above will be used.
